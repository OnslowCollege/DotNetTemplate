## .NET Template

Use this template to develop a program in .NET 8.

This template includes:

- Default code file (`Program.cs`)
- Extensions to support C# development
- Integration for diagrams.net (for files ending in `.drawio`)

**Note**: when run as a Codespace, .NET runs on Linux. You will not have access to Windows-specific technologies such as Windows Forms or WPF. However, you can use any .NET package that supports Linux by adding it as a project dependency.

## How to run your code

Once your Codespace has loaded:

1. to debug your code, click on the ▶️ play icon at the top-right of the screen (or press F5)
2. to run without debugging, click on the drop-down arrow next to the ▶️ play icon and select "Run project associated with this file" (or press Ctrl-F5)
